## 🔧 Cloud Security Optimization

### Query Performance Guidelines
```kql
// Performance-optimized cloud app query template
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(1h)  // Appropriate time window for detection rules
| where Application == "Microsoft SharePoint Online"  // Filter early on indexed fields
| where ActionType in ("FileDownloaded", "FileShared")  // Specific action types
| summarize count() by AccountDisplayName, bin(Timestamp, 10m)
| where count_ > 10  // Threshold-based filtering
```

### Integration Recommendations
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Export high-risk cloud activities for correlation
- **Cloud App Security**: Supplement native MCAS detection capabilities
- **DLP Integration**: Enhance data loss prevention with behavioral analytics
- **SIEM Forwarding**: Send critical cloud security alerts to central platform

### Detection Rule Templates
```kql
// Template for cloud application detection rules
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(1h)
| [your cloud security detection logic]
| extend 
    AlertTitle = "Cloud Application Security Alert",
    AlertSeverity = "High",
    Category = "Data Exfiltration"
| project 
    Timestamp,
    AlertTitle,
    AlertSeverity,
    Category,
    AccountDisplayName,
    Application,
    ActionType,
    Evidence = strcat("Suspicious ", ActionType, " activity in ", Application)
```
