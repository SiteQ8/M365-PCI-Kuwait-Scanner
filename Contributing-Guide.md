## üìä Query Performance Guidelines

### Performance Best Practices

1. **Time Range Optimization**
   ```kql
   // Always specify time ranges
   | where Timestamp > ago(24h)  // For real-time detection
   | where Timestamp > ago(7d)   // For trend analysis
   ```

2. **Filtering Efficiency**
   ```kql
   // Filter early and often
   DeviceProcessEvents
   | where Timestamp > ago(24h)           // Time filter first
   | where DeviceName has "SERVER"        // Device filter second
   | where ProcessCommandLine has "cmd"   // Content filter third
   ```

3. **Result Set Limitation**
   ```kql
   // Limit results to prevent timeouts
   | take 1000                    // Limit to 1000 results
   | top 100 by Timestamp desc    // Top 100 most recent
   ```

4. **Join Optimization**
   ```kql
   // Use appropriate join types
   | join kind=inner     // When you need matches in both tables
   | join kind=leftouter // When you need all left table records
   ```

### Performance Testing

Before submitting, test your queries with:
- **24-hour time range** - Should complete within 30 seconds
- **7-day time range** - Should complete within 2 minutes  
- **30-day time range** - Should complete within 5 minutes

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy Considerations

### Data Privacy Guidelines

1. **No Sensitive Data in Examples**
   - Use example.com for domain names
   - Use 192.168.1.x for IP addresses
   - Use placeholder user names like "user@domain.com"

2. **Anonymization Requirements**
   ```kql
   // Anonymize sensitive information
   | extend AnonymizedUser = hash_sha256(AccountName)
   | project-away AccountName  // Remove original sensitive field
   ```

3. **Compliance Considerations**
   - Ensure queries comply with local data protection laws
   - Consider data retention policies
   - Respect privacy regulations (GDPR, local equivalents)

### Responsible Disclosure

- **No live malware samples** in the repository
- **No active C2 domains** or IP addresses
- **Historical threat indicators only** (>30 days old)
- **Coordinate with vendors** for 0-day disclosures

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Query Performance Issues**
```kql
// Add appropriate time filters
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)

// Use efficient filtering
| where DeviceName in ("Server1", "Server2")  // Use 'in' for multiple values
```

**False Positive Reduction**
```kql
// Add exclusion filters
| where not (ProcessCommandLine has_any ("legitimate.exe", "approved.exe"))

// Use statistical thresholds
| where ConnectionCount > 100  // Adjust based on environment
```

**Documentation Standards**
- Always include MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Provide customization guidance
