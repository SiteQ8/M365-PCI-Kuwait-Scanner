## 📊 Query Usage Guidelines

### Performance Optimization
- **Time Range**: Always specify appropriate time ranges (typically 1-24 hours for real-time monitoring)
- **Device Filtering**: Use device name patterns specific to your banking environment
- **Exclusions**: Maintain whitelist of authorized banking applications and processes

### Customization for Your Environment
1. **Device Naming**: Update device name patterns to match your organization's naming convention
2. **Application Names**: Modify process and file name filters for your specific banking software
3. **Network Ranges**: Update IP ranges and ports for your banking network infrastructure
4. **Time Zones**: Adjust time-based queries for your local business hours

### Deployment Recommendations
- **Test Environment**: Always validate queries in non-production environment first
- **Gradual Rollout**: Start with detection rules in "audit mode" before enabling blocking
- **Tuning Period**: Allow 2-4 weeks for initial tuning to reduce false positives
- **Regular Updates**: Review and update queries monthly based on new threat intelligence

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Compliance Requirements
- **PCI DSS**: Queries support card data environment monitoring requirements
- **SOX**: Assists with financial controls monitoring and audit trails  
- **Basel III**: Supports operational risk management requirements
- **Local Regulations**: Adaptable for regional banking compliance (CBK, SAMA, etc.)

### Data Privacy
- **Anonymization**: Consider anonymizing account numbers and personal identifiers in logs
- **Retention**: Align query result retention with data protection policies  
- **Access Control**: Implement proper RBAC for accessing hunting results
